A small project to evaluate the use of the harmony search algorithm for pathfinding in games. I aim to expand on work I previously did at university and create an application that evaluates the algorithm's performance against the A* star algorithm. The idea for this project came after an informal discussion at the monthly games wales meetup. 

Though the initial study was limited in its approach, initial findings suggested that a 'good enough' path could be generated, and it was speculated that with some post-processing on the generated path, a suitable solution could be obtained.

This project is written entirely in C++ and contains automated tests using the Google Test framework. 

At time of writing (14/11/2018), I would not recommend making pull requests yet. The project is at an early stage of development and I will most likely ignore them.
